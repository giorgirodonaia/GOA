                <p>Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's first internal combustion engine in a car,<br>
                     seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen – financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886[11]<br>
                      – and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach,<br>
                    with the addition of a petrol engine, introduced later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first   <br>    
                    marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG).</p>
